<summary><h3> 👩🏻‍💻 Tia's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
My coding journey started when I was a teenager, back when MySpace was at the top of the social media hierarchy. Wanting my page to stand out above my friend's (<i>and so I could get into everyone's top 8</i>), I started to teach myself basic HTML/CSS. Within months I was being asked to code everyone's pages and match them to their individual and unique tastes. That was my first introduction to coding and I fell in love.
<br>
Over the years I dabbled in coding very casually and only did it for recreation while I worked multiple retail jobs. It was still one of my favorite things to do in my off time.
<br>
Starting in late 2021 I began to study coding more seriously, in an effort to achieve my ultimate dream goal of being able to work from home. Since then I've joined Promineo Tech's Front-End classes and through them I've been able to refine my coding skills and develop my own style with everything I've learned. I'm more confident about my work than I have ever been before. Even though I'm still finding my place, I wake up every day excited to learn something new in the vast and rapidly growing world of web development!
